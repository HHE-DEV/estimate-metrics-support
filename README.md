## Setup Estimates For Use

In order to setup the estimates for usage in the application then the table columns need to
be filtered inside your house call pro reporting dashboard as follows.

- [x] estimate
- [x] created at
- [ ] date
- [ ] end time
- [ ] total duration
- [x] customer
- [x] customer tags
- [ ] address
- [ ] street
- [ ] street line 2
- [ ] city
- [ ] state
- [ ] zip
- [ ] description
- [x] amount
- [ ] discount
- [ ] tax
- [ ] tax rate
- [ ] job tags
- [ ] notes
- [ ] employee
- [x] job status
- [ ] window
- [ ] attachments
- [ ] options

After the table columns have been filtered, then you can export the data for the date range you'd like to gain metrics on
and export as `csv` file that can be uploaded into the application.
